//------ Metals and Tools ------//
Iron and Gold require Create progress to smelt, and return reduced amounts.
Diamond ore will drop raw diamonds, which must be processed to be used for making tools.
- Raw diamond -> Diamond -> Diamond ingot
- Diamond ingots are used to upgrade iron tools and require steel in their creation

Wood and stone tools will not be accessible. Instead, the player will have to start with flint tools.
Flint tools can be used to get bronze tools. Copper then allows access to iron ore.

Iron tools will have their durability buffed over current values to make up for their difficulty in acquisition.
